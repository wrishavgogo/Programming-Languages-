Structure of the repo will be like 


Language -> Year -> # Month -> DateOfLearning -> This will contain a file or a pdf of what exactly I learnt . 

As of now we will be keeping it simple . For each day of learning we will keep a brief readme.md file in the folder to help me understand what i learnt that day and the resource itself .
