Why practicing machine coding of Snake Ladder Game , i was stuck with the code like how to generate a random Number between 1 to 6 while rolling a dice .

then i got to know about a class called RandomGenerator ---> RandomGenerator.getDefault().nextInt(minNumber , maxNumber); 

this method helps me generate a randomInteger b/w minNumber and maxNumber
