Today i watched 3 videos on youtube of which i made notes . I was mastering concurrency in java 

TODO : 1. Completable Future and ThreadLocal need to code live examples 
2. To Understand Java ForkJoinPool || WorkStealingPool -> will implement merge sort using this , and also segment tree operations using this
3. To understand Recursive Task 

I studied on 3rd feb and both 5th feb and these are notes of these .
